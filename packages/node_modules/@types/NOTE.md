The directory `packages/node_modules/@types` is a workaround to track type
definitions from DefinitelyTyped with local modifications. NPM packages should
not be installed at this level!

TypeScript searches for package type definition files in
`./node_modules/@types/`, `../node_modules/@types/`,
`../../node_modules/@types/` etc. relative to a project. That makes
`packages/node_modules/@types/` a convenient place to put type definitions
without mucking about with under-documented compiler options.
